Project Title: SlideSmith – Auto-Generate PowerPoint Presentations from Text

This project is a simple web application that helps users turn long pieces of text, such as notes, markdown, reports, or essays, into a clean and well-structured PowerPoint presentation. The idea is to save time and reduce manual formatting by allowing users to paste in content, optionally give a short instruction (like “make this an investor pitch”), and upload their own .pptx or .potx template. The app then uses a language model (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini, depending on what the user connects) to break the content into slides and summarize or format it accordingly. It also tries to reuse any images already present in the uploaded template to keep the visual consistency. The user can then directly download the generated .pptx file. Nothing is stored — no text, templates, or API keys — so privacy is maintained.

On the technical side, the backend is built with FastAPI in Python, using the python-pptx library to generate the presentations. The frontend is a simple responsive layout made with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, allowing users to input content, upload templates, and download results easily. To run it locally, one just needs to install the backend dependencies and start the server with Uvicorn. The app is also easy to deploy to platforms like Railway or Render.

Possible improvements in the future could include adding automatic speaker notes, giving users a few preset styles to choose from (like “sales deck” or “research summary”), and letting them preview slides before downloading. Overall, the goal of this project was to simplify the process of turning dense content into presentable slides quickly and flexibly.
